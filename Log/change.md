## [Initial Setup & Baseline Audit] - 2026-09-16
### Added
- Created `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with default SHA-256 hashed `admin` and `staff` user accounts.
- Created `.env` storing `DATABASE_URL`, `APPS_SCRIPT_URL`, `SPREADSHEET_ID`, and `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`.
- Created `.gitignore` to prevent secret leakage (`.env`, `secrets.toml`, `.clasprc.json`).
- Installed all missing baseline dependencies (`streamlit`, `pandas`, `Pillow`, `requests`, etc.).
- Cloned Google Apps Script project into `GAS/` using `clasp`.
- Created `Log/` folder containing `plan.md`, `documentation.md`, `Readme.md`, `change.md`, and `PR.md`.

## [Phase 1: GAS Modularization & Optimization] - 2026-09-16
### Completed
- **Deconstructed monolithic `GAS/Kode.js`** into 5 single-responsibility modules:
  - `Config.js`: Centralized spreadsheet/drive IDs, timeouts, and column header definitions.
  - `Auth.js`: API Key authentication validation helper.
  - `DriveService.js`: Encapsulated photo upload, Base64 decoding, and Drive permissions.
  - `SheetService.js`: Dynamic header mapping, selective column scanning, and `LockService` write serialization.
  - `Controller.js`: Dispatcher for `doGet` and `doPost`, standardized JSON output, backward-compatibility shims.
- **Removed `GAS/Kode.js`**: Replaced entirely by the modular architecture.
- **Pushed to Google Apps Script**: Successfully deployed with `clasp push` with zero errors.

## [Phase 2: Migration to Dockerized Web App (Vue 3 + Vite)] - 2026-09-16
### Completed
- **Built Vue 3 + Vite SPA (`web/`)**:
  - `web/src/assets/style.css`: Preserved and elevated the purple glassmorphic dark design system.
  - `web/src/utils/imageUtils.js`: Implemented client-side Canvas-based photo compression (max 1600px, JPEG 0.75) and dynamic side-by-side photo stitching (`gabungan.jpg`), removing server-side processing overhead.
  - `web/src/services/api.js`: Real-time inventory querying from Google Sheets with cache-busting and POST integration to Google Apps Script.
  - `web/src/services/auth.js`: Web Crypto API SHA-256 client authentication supporting `admin` and `staff` roles with persistent `localStorage` session state.
  - `web/src/components/`: Created `LoginForm.vue`, `SearchBar.vue`, `ItemCard.vue`, and `AddItemForm.vue`.
  - `web/src/App.vue`: Orchestrated tab navigation, live inventory filtering, and logout controls.
- **Containerization**:
  - `web/Dockerfile`: Multi-stage build (`node:20-alpine` build -> `nginx:alpine` runtime).
  - `web/nginx.conf`: Gzip compression and SPA routing configuration.
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Root orchestrator configured to expose web client on port `3000`.
- **Validation**:
  - Successfully verified dependencies (`npm install`) and production build (`npm run build` completed cleanly in 617ms).

## [Phase 3: Optimizations & Warehouse Intelligence] - 2026-09-16
### Completed
- **Google Apps Script Live Sync & User Auth (`GAS/`)**:
  - `SheetService.js`: Implemented `getAllItems()` for 0-second live inventory read directly from the spreadsheet. Added `getUsersSheet()` and `verifyUser()` to support accounts managed directly in a `"Users"` sheet tab.
  - `Controller.js`: Added `doGet?action=inventory` endpoint returning real-time JSON with execution time metrics and added `doPost` action `'login'` for remote credential verification.
  - `Config.js`: Migrated hardcoded IDs to native Google Apps Script environment variables (`PropertiesService.getScriptProperties()`) with dynamic getters and fallback support. Added `initializeScriptProperties()` helper.
  - Deployed to Google Apps Script via `sync_and_deploy.ps1` (Version 10 is now live).
- **Integrated Camera Barcode & QR Code Scanner (`web/`)**:
  - Installed `html5-qrcode` and built `BarcodeScannerModal.vue` with rear camera priority, audio/vibration detection feedback, and dark backdrop overlay.
  - Wired scanner to search bar for instant inventory lookup and to `AddItemForm.vue` for 1-click material code intake.
- **One-Click Audit CSV Export (`web/`)**:
  - Created `exportUtils.js` to download timestamped CSV files (`stock_opname_audit_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`) with Excel UTF-8 BOM compatibility.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) & Offline Resilience (`web/`)**:
  - Created `manifest.json` and `icon.svg` enabling "Add to Home Screen" on mobile devices.
  - Configured 3-tier inventory fetch strategy (Live GAS JSON -> Published CSV -> Local Storage Cache) with real-time offline connection status badge.
- **Streamlined Inventory Cards**:
  - Configured [ItemCard.vue](file:///d:/MyCode/New-Project/web/src/components/ItemCard.vue) and `app.py` to display strictly **one single main photo of the whole item** (`Foto 1`) with safe fallback, eliminating duplicate side-by-side images from cluttering the search view.
- **Build Verification**:
  - Verified `npm run build` inside `web/` with 0 errors (built in 1.42s).
